   o 16x8 Single precision micro-kernel 
   o Runnable on ARMv8+SVE, compiled with aarch64 GCC.
   o Use it together with the armv8_sve BLIS configuration.
   o Tested on Juawei arm nodes with ARMIE emulator.
   o Due to the fact that mr and nr depend on size of the vector
     registers, this kernel only works when size=256!!
