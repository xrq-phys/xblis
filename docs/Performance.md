# Introduction

This document showcases performance results for a representative sample of
level-3 operations on large matrices with BLIS and BLAS for several hardware
architectures.

# General information

Generally speaking, for level-3 operations on large matrices, we publish three
"panels" for each type of hardware,
each of which reports one of: single-threaded performance, multithreaded
performance on a single socket, or multithreaded performance on two sockets.
Each panel will consist of a 4x5 grid of graphs, with each row representing
a different datatype (single real, double real, single complex, and double
complex) and each column representing a different operation (`gemm`,
`hemm`/`symm`, `herk`/`syrk`, `trmm`, and `trsm`).
Each of the 20 graphs within a panel will contain an x-axis that reports
problem size, with all matrix dimensions equal to the problem size (e.g.
_m_ = _n_ = _k_), resulting in square matrices.
The y-axis will report in units GFLOPS (billions of floating-point operations
per second) in the case of single-threaded performance, or GFLOPS/core in the
case of single- or dual-socket multithreaded performance, where GFLOPS/core
is simply the total GFLOPS observed divided by the number of threads utilized.
This normalization is done intentionally in order to facilitate a visual
assessment of the drop in efficiency of multithreaded performance relative
to their single-threaded baselines.

It's also worth pointing out that the top of each graph (e.g. the maximum
y-axis value depicted) _always_ corresponds to the theoretical peak performance
under the conditions associated with that graph.
Theoretical peak performance, in units of GFLOPS/core, is calculated as the
product of:
1. the maximum sustainable clock rate in GHz; and
2. the maximum number of floating-point operations (flops) that can be
executed per cycle (per core).

Note that the maximum sustainable clock rate may change depending on the
conditions.
For example, on some systems the maximum clock rate is higher when only one
core is active (e.g. single-threaded performance) versus when all cores are
active (e.g. multithreaded performance).
The maximum number of flops executable per cycle (per core) is generally
computed as the product of:
1. the maximum number of fused multiply-add (FMA) vector instructions that
can be issued per cycle (per core);
2. the maximum number of elements that can be stored within a single vector
register (for the datatype in question); and
3. 2.0, since an FMA instruction fuses two operations (a multiply and an add).

The problem size range, represented on the x-axis, is usually sampled with 50
equally-spaced problem size.
For example, for single-threaded execution, we might choose to execute with
problem sizes of 48 to 2400 in increments of 48, or 56 to 2800 in increments
of 56.
These values are almost never chosen for any particular (read: sneaky) reason;
rather, we start with a "good" maximum problem size, such as 2400 or 2800, and
then divide it by 50 to obtain the appropriate starting point and increment.

Finally, each point along each curve represents the best of three trials.

# Interpretation

In general, the the curves associated with higher-performing implementations
will appear higher in the graphs than lower-performing implementations.
Ideally, an implementation will climb in performance (as a function of problem
size) as quickly as possible and asymptotically approach some high fraction of
peak performance.

Occasionally, we may publish graphs with incomplete curves--for example,
only the first 25 data points in a typical 50-point series--usually because
the implementation being tested was slow enough that it was not practical to
allow it to finish.

Where along the x-axis you focus your attention will depend on the segment of
the problem size range that you care about most. Some people's applications
depend heavily on smaller problems, where "small" can mean anything from 10
to 1000 or even higher. Some people consider 1000 to be quite large, while
others insist that 5000 is merely "medium." What each of us considers to be
small, medium, or large (naturally) depends heavily on the kinds of dense
linear algebra problems we tend to encounter. No one is "right" or "wrong"
about their characterization of matrix smallness or bigness since each person's
relative frame of reference can vary greatly. That said, the
[Science of High-Performance Computing](http://shpc.ices.utexas.edu/) group at
[The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) tends to target
matrices that it classifies as "medium-to-large", and so most of the graphs
presented in this document will reflect that targeting in their x-axis range.

When corresponding with us, via email or when opening an
[issue](https://github.com/flame/blis/issues) on github, we kindly ask that
you specify as closely as possible (though a range is fine) your problem
size of interest so that we can better assist you.

Therefore, when measuring OpenBLAS performance, the `GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY` environment variable was unset.
* Frequency throttling (via `cpupower`):
  * No changes made.
* Comments:
  * ARMPL performance is remarkably uneven across datatypes and operations, though it would appear their "base" consists of OpenBLAS, which they then optimize for select, targeted routines. Unfortunately, we were unable to test the absolute latest versions of OpenBLAS and ARMPL on this hardware before we lost access. We will rerun these experiments once we gain access to a similar system.

* Comments:
  * MKL yields superb performance for most operations, though BLIS is not far behind except for `trsm`. (We understand the `trsm` underperformance and hope to address it in the future.) OpenBLAS lags far behind MKL and BLIS due to lack of full support for AVX-512, and possibly other reasons related to software architecture and register/cache blocksizes.

  * MKL performance is dismal, despite being linked in the same manner as on the Xeon Platinum. It's not clear what is causing the slowdown. It could be that MKL's runtime kernel/blocksize selection logic is falling back to some older, more basic implementation because CPUID is not returning Intel as the hardware vendor. Alternatively, it's possible that MKL is trying to use kernels for the closest Intel architectures--say, Haswell/Broadwell--but its implementations use Haswell-specific optimizations that, due to microarchitectural differences, degrade performance on Zen.
